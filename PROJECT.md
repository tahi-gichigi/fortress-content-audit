# Fortress Content Audit - Project Rules

## Fortress-Specific Rules

### Forbidden
- **NEVER use example.com as a test domain** - use real domain names from the project context
- Never hallucinate API keys, event names, or property names - check existing code first

### Presenting Audit Results
- **Always return the full issue description and suggested fix** when showing audit results — never paraphrase or summarise. Include: severity, page URL, category, full `issue_description`, and full `suggested_fix`. The user needs the exact wording the model returned to evaluate whether it's a real issue or a false positive without guessing.
- When building a table of issues, include all fields. Truncating or rewording the model output hides the context needed for review.

### Audit Quality Philosophy
- **Fewer issues, higher confidence** — it's better to miss an edge case than to report false positives. Users lose trust in the tool when it flags things that aren't real issues.
- **Link auditing is internal-only** — only flag internal navigation links that are broken or point to the wrong page. Never flag mailto:, tel:, or external links as broken — AI models can't verify these from markdown and they're almost always fine on the live site.
- **Extraction artifacts are not issues** — Firecrawl's HTML-to-markdown conversion strips whitespace between adjacent HTML elements (e.g., `<span>The</span><span>simple</span>` becomes `Thesimple`). The prompts in `lib/audit-prompts.ts` include explicit caveats telling models to ignore these. If similar artifact patterns emerge, fix at the prompt level, not by modifying the crawled content.
- **HTML-direct is the future** — Validated approach: feed cleaned raw HTML (after strip-hidden-elements JS) directly to models instead of markdown. Eliminates extraction artifacts entirely. See ADR-001 for details. The strip script must preserve zero-dimension inline tags (`<br>`, `<img>`, `<svg>`, etc.).

### Supabase Security (migration 029)
- **RLS enabled on `blog_posts`** (no policies — locked down, table not in use)
- **RLS enabled on `guideline_versions`** — owner-scoped via parent `guidelines.user_id`
- **`email_captures` policy tightened** — anon INSERT only; GET/PUT routes use `supabaseAdmin`
- **5 functions patched** — `SET search_path = ''` added to prevent search_path hijacking
- **`brand_audit_runs` USING(true) intentionally kept** — see migration 012 comment
- **Leaked password protection not yet enabled** — requires SMTP configured in Supabase Auth first (Authentication → Settings → SMTP Settings), then toggle under Authentication → Attack Protection

### Testing
- **For AI prompt or model/API changes: always run a real end-to-end audit test before pushing to prod** — prompt wording directly affects output quality and regressions are invisible without live testing
- Always test: PDF export, Supabase/PostHog/OpenAI integrations, auth flows, DB migrations

### Analytics & Tracking (PostHog)
- Feature flags: Use enums/const objects, keep usage centralized
- Custom properties used 2+ times: Store in enum/const object
- Naming convention: `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORE` for flag/property names
- Gate flag-dependent code with validation checks
- Before creating event/property names, check for existing naming conventions

## Project Overview
Content audit SaaS platform built with Next.js, Supabase, and AI integrations. Helps brands audit website content for quality, consistency, and clarity issues.

## Key Technologies
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes, Supabase (PostgreSQL), Supabase Auth
- **PDF Export:** Client-side html2pdf.js
- **Analytics:** PostHog
- **AI:** OpenAI API (gpt-5.1-2025-11-13 via Responses API)
- **Tracing:** LangSmith (`aicontentaudit` project) — enabled on production via Vercel env vars

## Project Structure
- `/app` - Next.js app router pages and API routes
- `/lib` - Utility functions, helpers, and services
- `/components` - React components
- `/types` - TypeScript type definitions
- `.claude/commands/` - Claude Code slash commands

## Useful Commands
- `/check` - Review implementation critically
- `/rating` - Rate an implementation
- `/deslop` - Remove AI-generated code bloat
- `/kill` - Kill all Next.js dev servers
- `/push-to-github` - Push to GitHub with clear commit
- `/vlow` - Reminder to keep verbosity low
- `/confidence` - Rate confidence in assessment

## Architecture Decisions
Recorded in `docs/decisions/` as numbered ADRs. Check these before making changes to the audit pipeline.
- [ADR-001](docs/decisions/001-strip-hidden-elements-before-extraction.md) — Strip hidden DOM elements before Firecrawl markdown extraction
- [ADR-002](docs/decisions/002-two-pass-checker-with-html-compression.md) — Two-pass pipeline: liberal auditor + model checker with HTML compression
- [ADR-003](docs/decisions/003-auditor-model-gpt5mini-rejected.md) — Auditor model: gpt-5-mini rejected, gpt-5.1 confirmed

## Audit Architecture

### Tiers
- **FREE** → `parallelMiniAudit` — 3 category models + optional brand voice, 5 pages, 10 tool calls
- **PAID** → `parallelProAudit` — same structure, 20 pages, 30 tool calls + two-pass checker
- **ENTERPRISE** → `auditSite` sequential + brand voice pass, 60 tool calls

### Two-Pass Pipeline (PAID tier)
The Pro audit uses a liberal auditor → model checker flow:
1. **Auditor pass**: 3 parallel category models (Language / Facts & Consistency / Links & Formatting), each scanning all pages. Liberal prompt ("when in doubt, include it") maximises recall.
2. **Checker pass**: 3 parallel checker calls (one per category). Each receives the full compressed HTML for pages with issues in that category. Drops issues with `confirmed=false` or `confirmed=uncertain` + confidence <0.7.
- Two-pass confirmed to produce ~97% avg confidence, <15% drop rate across benchmark sites.
- Checker grouped by category (not page) so it sees cross-page contradiction evidence.

### Content Extraction Pipeline
All tiers use Firecrawl → semantic HTML compression → model input:
1. **Firecrawl** — bot-protected crawl + page selection (map → select → scrape)
2. **`stripHtmlNoise`** — removes scripts, comments, SVG internals
3. **`compressHtml`** (`lib/html-compressor.ts`) — strips class/id/style/data-* attrs, unwraps inline formatting tags (`<strong>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<span>` etc. — auditing never needs bold/italic context), collapses SVGs to placeholders. Typically 60-80% size reduction on Tailwind pages.
4. **DOM-aware chunking** — pages still >60K chars after compression are split at semantic boundaries (section/article children of main)
5. **Element manifest** — extracted from raw HTML (pre-compression) and appended to auditor prompt. NOT sent to checker (redundant — checker only verifies existence of issues in HTML).

### Prompt Caching (cost optimisation)
`buildLiberalCategoryAuditPrompt` puts the full site HTML manifest FIRST so the 3 parallel category calls share an identical prefix. OpenAI caches this prefix, reducing token cost on calls 2 and 3 by ~50% for the shared prefix tokens.

### Cost Profile (current, post Run 3 optimisations)
- ~$0.93-1.14/site (6 calls × ~100-136K input tokens × $1.25/M input, $10/M output)
- Model: `gpt-5.1-2025-11-13` for both auditor and checker
- Run 3 optimisations applied: inline tag stripping, manifest-first prompt caching, no manifest in checker
- See `docs/eval-baseline.md` for full benchmark history and `docs/decisions/` for cost reduction options considered

### Issue Persistence (cross-audit context)
Each re-audit feeds two context blocks into the model prompts:
- **`# Active Issues`** — active issues from the most recent prior audit (via `getActiveIssues`). Model verifies if they still exist.
- **`# Previously Resolved/Ignored Issues`** — resolved/ignored issues across all prior audits (via `getExcludedIssues`). Model is told not to report these again.

Both are filtered by category before being injected (so the Language model only sees Language context). Confirmed working end-to-end via LangSmith token delta (Language prompt is ~190 tokens larger than Facts/Links due to category-filtered excluded issues).

### Preset → Brand Voice Profile Handling (`app/api/audit/route.ts`)
The `preset` param from the picker controls how the brand voice profile is built:
- **No DB profile** → synthetic profile built from picker options
- **`preset=custom` + existing DB profile** → picker options OVERRIDE the DB profile for fields the picker controls (`flag_ai_writing`, `readability_level`, `locale`, `formality`). Voice summary, enabled, keywords preserved from DB.
- **`preset=full` + existing DB profile** → augment with readability + AI detection defaults if not set
- **`preset=quick`** → disable brand voice pass entirely

### Test Scripts
- `test-issue-persistence.ts` — DB-level verification of getExcludedIssues/getActiveIssues queries
- `test-e2e-persistence.ts` — Full E2E: marks issues resolved, runs real prod audit, verifies context in traces
  - Uses `supabase.auth.admin.generateLink` + `anonClient.auth.verifyOtp` to get a bearer token without a password
